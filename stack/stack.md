# Stack in Javascript

#### The Stack class implements a basic stack data structure with the following methods:

- push(element): Adds an element to the top of the stack.
- pop(): Removes and returns the top element of the stack. If the stack is empty, returns a message.
- isEmpty(): Checks if the stack is empty and returns true if it is, otherwise false.
- peek(): Returns the top element of the stack without removing it. If the stack is empty, returns a message.
- size(): Returns the number of elements in the stack.
- print(): Returns a string representation of all elements in the stack, separated by spaces.
- clear(): Removes all elements from the stack.
- reverse(): Reverses the order of elements in the stack.
- contains(element): Checks if an element is present in the stack and returns true if it is, otherwise false.
