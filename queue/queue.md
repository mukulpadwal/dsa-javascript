# Queue in Javascript

This Queue class provides an implementation of a basic queue data structure. A queue is a collection of elements that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle, meaning the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed.

#### Methods:
1. enqueue(element): Adds an element to the end of the queue.
2. dequeue(): Removes and returns the front element from the queue. If the queue is empty, it returns "Queue is Empty!!!".
3. isEmpty(): Checks if the queue is empty.
4. size(): Returns the number of elements in the queue.
5. peek(): Returns the front element of the queue without removing it. If the queue is empty, it returns "Queue is Empty!!!".
6. print(): Returns a string representation of the elements in the queue.
7. contains(element): Checks if a specific element is present in the queue.
8. reverse(): Reverses the order of elements in the queue.
9. clear(): Clears all elements from the queue.
